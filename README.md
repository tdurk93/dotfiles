# Dotfiles

This repository represents a collection of configuration files I use for Linux.
It has been pieced together from viewing many examples of files from other
people, particularly for my `.vimrc` and my `.zshrc`.

These are available largely for my own use, but I hope someone else can find
something in mine that they like.

They are [MIT licensed](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

## TODO

- add installation script
- add installation instructions
- list resources of where I got these files from
